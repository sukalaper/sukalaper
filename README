Hi, there. âœ¨

this is my github page, i have the right to decide anything in it.
but I still respect the rules. maybe, lol.
including I will write a blog in it without using a website (yes it sounds stupid even though I have bought a .xyz domain, but that's what I have in mind right now) xixi.

maybe some of my repos will contain about how my day was (if I don't forget to write it up), my dotfiles, some of my simple programs that I've learned through university, etc.
and please don't think i'm a hacker or programmer.
again, please, don't.
