Hi, there. âœ¨
-------------

// greetings.
// ----------
this is my Github page, i have the right to decide anything in it.
but I still respect the rules. maybe, xD.
including I will write a blog in it without using a website (yes it sounds stupid even though I have bought a .xyz domain, but that's what I have in mind right now) xixi.
maybe some of my repos will contain about how my Day was (if I don't forget to write it up), my dotfiles, some of my simple programs that I've learned through University, etc.
and please don't think I'm a programmer.
again, please, don't.

// how to read ?
// -------------
about the directory folder, maybe later I will place it like this (maybe it can change over time).
README
    \
     $DIR
   /      \
README.md  \
          $DIR

// about.
// ------
sukalaper?
easy, it's just a name I've used since high school.
inspired by one of my friends who has a unique LINE ID, sayalapar.
