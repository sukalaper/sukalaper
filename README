Hi there!

----------------------------------------------------
I am here to tell you a story,
A story that will torture your thoughts by day,
And poison your dreams by night,
And though i will do my best,
There are no words that can be written,
Nor brush strokes laid on canvas that can describe,
This dark and utter horror of the night that Annabel died,
The emptiness will haunt you.
