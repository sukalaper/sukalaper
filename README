Hi, there. âœ¨
-------------

// greetings.
// ----------
this is my Github page, i have the right to decide anything in it.
but I still respect the rules. maybe, xD.
including I will write a blog in it without using a website (yes it sounds stupid even though I have bought a .xyz domain, but that's what I have in mind right now) xixi.
maybe some of my repos will contain about blog, how my Day was (if I don't forget to write it up), my dotfiles, some of my simple programs that I've learned through University, etc.
and please don't think I'm a programmer.
once again, please, don't.

// how to read?
// ------------
about the directory folder, maybe later I will place it like this (maybe it can change over time).
README
    \
     $DIR
   /      \
README.md  \
           $DIR
             \
            $FILE
you may be wondering why I use double README and README.md, right?
I like the font that appears in README over README.md because it still looks simple, but on the other hand for a detailed explanation of whatever I write later, I will continue to use README.md with style, writing conditions, and all the complexities of markdown.

sukalaper? easy, it's just a name I've used since high school.
inspired by one of my friends who has a unique LINE ID, sayalapar.
